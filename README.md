# Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Prediction

This project focuses on predicting vehicle fuel efficiency using the Auto MPG dataset.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to understand how different vehicle features affect fuel efficiency and to build a machine learning model that can make reliable predictions.

## Dataset
Auto MPG dataset containing features such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin.

## Approach
- Performed basic data cleaning and analysis
- Studied relationships between vehicle features
- Built and tested multiple regression models
- Compared predicted values with actual values using visualizations

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Outcome
The project helped identify key factors influencing fuel efficiency and demonstrated how machine learning can be applied to real-world automotive data.
